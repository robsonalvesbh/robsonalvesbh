### Hey Folks! üòÅ

My name is Robson Alves, I am currently living in S√£o Paulo - Brazil, I have a degree in computer science and I work with web development for over 6 years. I am currently a software engineer at OLX Brazil and work as a freelancer in my spare time, I've had the opportunity to participate in projects of large companies such as Maxmilhas, SambaTech, Cielo, Totvs, Kroton, among others.

I like the dynamics that development gives me, I'm very active in software communities, I'm a lifelong learner and I'm addicted to topics like good practices, clean code, software architecture, serverless and other things around highly scalable applications. ;-)

Would you like to find me?
